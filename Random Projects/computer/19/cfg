-- EDITABLE VARIABLES --------------------------------------------------------

fileName = "nakeyjakey esports [20594]" -- The name of the animation to load, without '.txt' at the end. '[' and ']' are reserved characters for the frame count at the end of the name, like 'dog 1 [5]'.
--fileName = "never gonna give you up [5302]" -- The name of the animation to load, without '.txt' at the end. '[' and ']' are reserved characters for the frame count at the end of the name, like 'dog 1 [5]'.
--fileName = "earth dog [72]" -- The name of the animation to load, without '.txt' at the end. '[' and ']' are reserved characters for the frame count at the end of the name, like 'dog 1 [5]'.
--fileName = "albedo [1]" -- The name of the animation to load, without '.txt' at the end. '[' and ']' are reserved characters for the frame count at the end of the name, like 'dog 1 [5]'.
computerType = "desktop" -- "desktop" or "laptop".
showFrameCounter = true -- Whether the program displays the frame count.
loop = true -- Whether the program loops the animation.
generateOptimizedCode = true -- Whether the program will generate an optimized file containing all instructions. Takes time and system memory to create, but executes the drawing way faster.

slow = false -- If this is true, the program sleeps by 'slowTime' seconds. If this is false, the program doesn't sleep.
slowTime = 2 -- If 'slow' is set to true, this is the time slept between drawn frames in seconds.

x = 1
y = 1

frameSleeping = true -- Whether the program sleeps between drawing each frame, by frameSleep number of seconds.
frameSleep = 0.05 -- Seconds of sleeping between frames, -1 is no sleeping.

maxFramesPerGeneratedCodeFile = 1000 -- How many frames can be written to a generated code file in .generatedCodeFiles/ before a new one gets created. 

-- Less important variables.
leverSide = "right" -- Lever can be pulled to turn off the program.
